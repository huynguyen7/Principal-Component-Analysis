# PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
This repository contains implementation for _Principal Component Analysis_ in Python (used with `Numpy`):
- Used for reducing the dimensionality of a data set (having a large number of correlated variables), while retaining as much as possible of the variation in the dataset.
- Ideally, the eigenvectors with high eigenvalues are the principal components (new dimension) of the data set.
